# Downloading This Project
Download and clone this repository, and you can find the instructions from GitHub guides on YouTube. You need 1) NodeJS, 2) VS Code, 3) Git for Windows/Mac/Linux, 4) GitHub Client, 5) GitHub Account, 6) Google Chrome for this to be a useful.

## Starting Developments
Automatically, "node modules" are deleted and ignored by GitHub upon pulling this into a branch. You need to run this code:

```bash
npm install
```

This code install all of the node modules needed for the website to run. This is similar to downloading a toy car but then not having batteries within it. npm install is like adding batteries to your project.

## During Developments
Watch guides on how to work with SvelteKit. This tends to be very helpful for ppl with backgrounds on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you want to "run" your website into your browser, put:

```bash
npm run dev
```

There will be a link of http://localhost:5173/, and run that into your device. As you save your edits within VS Code while coding, the website within chome will refresh as you type. This is called *hot reload*. If you're done, just close it all off. If you're done editing or have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me!
